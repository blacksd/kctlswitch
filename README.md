# kctlswitch
A tfswitch-inspired command-line tool to change kubectl version

## What's up with the name?

A significative portion of a project's success lies in its name and I know I could have done better on that department. There are lots of great alternatives but either [they're already taken](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-devel/doc/user/user_commands/kswitch.html) or don't adhere to the [strict regulations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wgAIvXpJqU) that govern the pronunciation of `kubectl`.

So, until a magic PR pops up and fixes that, `kctlswitch` is what it's going to be :smile:
